# Data Analyst Portfolio
Hi, my name is Tien, I warmly welcome you to come to this site and observe my portfolio which includes several projects  related to SQL, Power PI, and Python that I made during my learning with the goal of becoming a data analyst in the near future 

## [Project 1 - Python + Power BI] 
[Python](https://github.com/minhtien221197/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/project-1/CRAWL%20AND%20PRE%20PROCESSING%20DATA%20FROM%20CAREERVIET%20WEBSITE.ipynb)

[Power BI](https://github.com/minhtien221197/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/project-1/JOB%20MARKET%20ANALYST.pbix)
### Description

Context

This project was made in order to analyze the demand of data analyst, Business Intelligence and Business Analyst positions. By using python, I crawl data from website and then clean and normalize the data before importing those data into Power Bi to make dashboard and draw conclusion

Todo list

    Crawl and EDA data set using python

    Import cleaned data into Power BI
  
    Visualize data into meaningful insights by appropriate charts, table

## [Project 2 - Microsoft Excel]
[Dashboard](https://github.com/minhtien221197/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/DASHBOARD%20MONITORING%20SALES%20VOLUME%20IN%20DAV%20-%20FY'24.xlsm)
### Description
Context

This project aims to monitor sales and warehouse volumes for all branches in DAV and identify a few abnormal patters in sales behavior. Some metrics are defined, for instance the percentage of sales volume in the last 6 days, how many sales orders were violated the cut-off time , inventory ratio, warehouse inbound  - outbound volume ,etc

Todo list

    Extract data from AX system and apply VBA to pre - process raw data before storing into another sheet in Excel
    Design data model by generating Dim and Fact tables by Power Pivot
    Create pivot tables for the purpose of drawing appropriate charts and metrics


## [Project 3 - Microsoft Excel]
[Dashboard](https://github.com/minhtien221197/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/Dashboard%20-%20DAV%20Transportation%20Cost.xlsm)
### Description
Context

A real project when working in Daikin. As usual, my manager monitors the transportation cost as well as the KPI performance of vendors based on the raw data file on an Excel with a large number of numbers which is good because it is very detailed. However, watching a lot of numbers makes it harder to draw insight compared to charts. Thus I made a Dashboard on an Excel file to visualize those numbers into meaningful information by drawing some vivid and attractive charts

Disclaimer: These costs in the Dashboard had been modified to preserve  the security and privacy of the company

Todo list

    Replace traditional reports with large numbers and templates that lack insights  
    Integrate data from different workbooks into a single dashboar


## [Project 4 -Machine Learning]
[Python](https://github.com/minhtien221197/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/CREDIT%20SCORE%20CLASSIFICATION%20(1).ipynb)

[Presentation](https://github.com/minhtien221197/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/CREDIT%20SCORE%20CLASSIFICATION.pptx)
### Description
Context

Assume that you are working as a data scientist in a global finance company. Over the years, the company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts and apply different strategies for each customer's group


Todo list

    Clean data using numpy, pandas

    EDA data using matplotlib, seaborn

    Encode the data

    Handle imbalanced data to increase the precision of the model

    Build predictive model. Eg: Logistics, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes

    Evaluate result
