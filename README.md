# Data Analyst Portfolio
Hi, my name is Tien, I warmly welcome you to come to this site and observe my portfolio which includes several projects  related to SQL, Power PI, and Python that I made during my learning with the goal of becoming a data analyst in the near future 

## [Project 1 - Python + Power BI] 
[Python](https://github.com/minhtien221197/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/project-1/CRAWL%20AND%20PRE%20PROCESSING%20DATA%20FROM%20CAREERVIET%20WEBSITE.ipynb)

[Power BI](https://github.com/minhtien221197/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/project-1/JOB%20MARKET%20ANALYST.pbix)
### Description

Context
Assume that you are a data analyst working for an e-commerce company named X. Your mission is to prepare a presentation to present about an overview of the company's business and operation, for the CEO and COO. The presentation must include the following  information:  business overview, and customer satisfaction, and recommend at least two  aspects that could be improved in the future

Todo list

    EDA data set using python
  
    Transform data using Power PI
  
    Use DAX to compute additional metrics that did not appear in the original data
  
    Visualize data into meaningful insights by appropriate charts, table

## [Project 2 - Microsoft Excel](https://github.com/minhtien221197/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/Dashboard%20-%20DAV%20Transportation%20Cost.xlsm)
### Description
Context

A real project when working in Daikin. As usual, my manager monitors the transportation cost as well as the KPI performance of vendors based on the raw data file     on an Excel with a  large number of numbers which is good because it is very detailed. However, watching a lot of numbers makes it harder to draw insight   compared to charts. Thus I made a Dashboard on an Excel file to visualize those numbers into meaningful information by drawing some vivid and attractive charts

Disclaimer: These costs in the Dashboard had been modified to preserve  the security and privacy of the company

Todo list

    Use power query to combine data in different workbooks and transform them in an automatic way

    Draw suitable charts serving for KPI and cost monitoring


## [Project 3 -Machine Learning](https://github.com/minhtien221197/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/CREDIT%20SCORE%20CLASSIFICATION%20(1).ipynb)
### Description
Context

Assume that you are working as a data scientist in a global finance company. Over the years, the company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts and apply different strategies for each customer's group


Todo list

    Clean data using numpy, pandas

    EDA data using matplotlib, seaborn

    Encode the data

    Handle imbalanced data to increase the precision of the model

    Build predictive model. Eg: Logistics, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes

    Evaluate result
